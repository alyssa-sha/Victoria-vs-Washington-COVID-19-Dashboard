# 5-10-2020
*Actions for this week:*
1. Finish analysis and visualisations (charts) by end of Thursday (11:55pm!)
2. Pull charts together into a dashboard (Jeff and Atif)
3. Prepare final report

*Individual tasks*
Rachael: Finish collecting US Census data for the following:
            - household income
            - age categories
            - education levels
        Note: this is now done. Files can be found in folders in the Data directory. I've uploaded the metadata and text files too for context.
        
        Finish off analysis for income vs COVID cases, add US county data to scatterplot and transfer vis to bokeh.
        Use a weighting of the state median income against the national median income to compare income in USA and Australia.
        
Courtney: Add data labels to both charts (pie and bar chart). Create the bar chart in bokeh. Run analyses on Washington data and produce charts.

Alyssa: Create a chart showing age vs infection rate across the whole of Vic and compare to a similar analysis across all of Washington state. Add US data to the existing scatterplot, if possible?

Jeff: keep looking for data showing gender split of cases in Washington state. Alternatively, look at timeline data in Victoria.

Atif: Finish task 5. Liaise with Jeff to bring all the visualisations together.

*Next meeting*
Friday 9 October, 5:30pm, Zoom  - to work out a plan for drafting final report.


# 28-09-2020
*Actions for this week:*
Finish tasks this week. Get some sort of visual
Use Bokeh for visualisations

*To do list for everyone this week (Due 4th Oct)*
Rachael: Download US Census data (Washington State) to repository; compare with Australian Census data; 
        decide whether/how data could be compared and draw up a revised sketch for 
        the visualisations/dashboard
        If time, start on tasks related to income level (task 1)
        
Alyssa: Task2_Age (Include basic code, uni test code, visualization)

Courtney: Task3_Education (Include basic code, uni test code, visualization)

Atif: Task4_Occupation (Include basic code, uni test code, visualization)

Jeff: Task5 (Include basic code, uni test code, visualization)

*Deliverables for next*:
Do same tasks on American data
Atif and Jeff: create dashboard; combine the code, test and visualization
Rachael, Alyssa and Courtney: create report

Need to finish at end of next week. Due Oct 11

# 21-09-2020, 6:30PM, Zoom

Attendees: Rachael Eddowes, Atif Mahmood, Alyssa Sha

Notes:
Rachael asked whether Atif (visualisation team) would like us to define data structures to work with.
This led to a discussion of how we might chart US data against Victoria, and the uncertainty at this 
point around the details of the US Census data and how comparable it mgiht be with the Australian 
dataset. Rachael to find, download and compare US Census data to start making some comparisons.

While this investigation is happening, Alyssa and Atif will start cleaning and analysing the data we 
have for Victoria.

In terms of milestones, we will aim to get most of the analysis for Victoria done this week, then 
adapt this to the USA next week, and in the final week Jeff and Atif will focus on building the 
visualisation, while Rachael, Courtney and Alyssa will finish any remaining analysis and prepare the 
report.

*Actions for this week:*
Rachael: Download US Census data to repository; compare with Australian Census data; 
        decide whether/how data could be compared and draw up a revised sketch for 
        the visualisations/dashboard
        If time, start on tasks related to income level (task 1)
        
Alyssa: Work through the analysis tasks Courtney identified related to 
                        age groups level (tasks 2)

Courtney: Task 3 education                       
                        
Atif: Work through tasks related to industry of work (task 4)

Jeff: Start working through the tasks related to gender, cases and deaths (task 5). This is likely to 
        be more complicated than the other tasks as it involves both cases and deaths.

- Next meeting: 28/9/20, 6:30pm, Zoom -
